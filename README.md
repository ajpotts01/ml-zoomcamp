# ML Zoomcamp

This is a repository for me to learn from datatalksclub/Alexey Grigorev's [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code)

Most of the early chapters will be notebooks where I follow the YouTube tutorials exactly.

This started out with good intentions to make the code cleaner and not just the usual notebook mess, but that was taking a LOT of time even in the early chapters.

As I get to the serving parts, I'll resume making this as clean as possible (at least as far as my opinions go) - I'm learning this more for ML Engineering parts as opposed to pure data science. I'll start using proper pull requests etc. once I get to that as well.
